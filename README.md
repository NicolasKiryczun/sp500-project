## About the Project

My interest in investing led me to explore different datasets related to the Standard and Poor’s 500 Index, the most well-known representative of the U.S. stock market. For my analysis, I used the dataset titled “S&P 500 Historical Data.” This dataset contains records from 1928 to 2025, offering a long timeline that provides a quantitative look into the history of this iconic index.

To present this dataset in a new light, I transformed it to show the annual percentage changes in stock prices. I created two tables: one for each year's first trading day and another for the last trading day. I then joined these tables and calculated the year-over-year percentage change. Additionally, I added a column to classify each year as positive or negative based on the returns.

After cleaning and transforming the data, I imported it into Power BI, where I created a dashboard using various graphs and KPIs to highlight the history of this famous index. Taking advantage of Power BI’s interactive features, I added slicers to the dashboard, allowing users to explore the data themselves. I also included categorical slicers that let users view notable periods in the S&P 500’s history.
